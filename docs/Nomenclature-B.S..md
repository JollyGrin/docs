"It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!" Bruce Lee.

The technology is cool, and that's what this project is about, THE WAY is nameless, as they say. Words obfuscate and obstruct, so why not embrace that reality by maintaining a nomenclature of quirky wizard/witch vibes, shrouded in a light and funky aloofness? I think packaging up what aims to be a key to international freedom in a somewhat silly package is like a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. Funny names are an invisibility cloak.

If it weren't explicitly useful (in my opinion) to name things unconventionally, and if there was not already a magical-theme happening within the project, it would not be worth pursuing. But as we have already stepped in it, so to speak, there are many things we can do to "unBrand" the project in an effective way.

_We obviously don't want to cross the line into copyright infringement. There are plenty of historical and wizardly themes to choos from that are not strictly inspired by modern novels._

GRIN (GOBLINS' Righteous Intergalactic Network)

# Council Name
What do we call the "technomity" aka the Council of Grin, given it certainly doesn't matter, and there are so many fun witchy things to choose from? This group will be cited by name when future upgrades, discussions, and decisions arise. Some ideas:
* The GAMUT (Grin's Ancient Masters of Upgrades and Transitioning)
* Spontaneous Order of GOBLINS
* GOBLINS (GRIN's Own Beaurocracy of Laborers, Improvers, Nurturers and Scientists or GRIN's Own Beurocracy of Learned Integrators Negotiators and Scientists)
* Ministry of Mages
* Coven of Alchemical Liason Maintainance (CALM... keep CALM and carry wands).
* The Spontaneous Order of Unknown Leaders (SOUL, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order#Markets ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order#Markets))
* The Stygmergic Syzygy
* Institute of Broom and Wand Design
* Magical Undertakings of Money (MUMs the word!)
* P.O.W.O.W. (which could stand for The POWOW Order of Wizards Ongoing Work… which has that nice nested GNU thing… and actually we’ve already been calling it the powow… plus the connotations for proof of work, POW, and pain, OW… but is probably incensitive to native americans)
* Sobornost (“the combination of freedom and unity of many persons on the basis of their common love for the same absolute values.”, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobornost)
* Synod (church council)
* Conventicle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventicle)
* Conciliabulum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conciliabulum)
* navem civitatis - ship of state (platos coinage of philosopher king)
* technicorum magorum™ - technocracy of magi
* Ministry of Magi (MOM said!)
* Convention of Wizards (COW goes MU (Mimblewimble Undertakings))
* Chamber of Intermagical Affairs, aka the CIA?
* Assembly of Seers? Seer Association? Seers, Robust &amp; Company?

# Wallet/Miner Names
These are all totally free to use for any efforts.
* Wink
* Nod
* Smirk

# Currency name [Solved]
In what units do we measure the grin currency?
* grins (milli, micro, etc).
* Winks and Nods?
